# GardenGraphApp

GardenGraphApp is an Android application that visualizes a graph coloring problem through an interactive garden-themed interface. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, it allows users to configure a network of gardens, define paths between them, and display a graph where each garden is assigned one of four flower types (colors), ensuring no adjacent gardens share the same type. Powered by a greedy coloring algorithm, this app provides a dynamic and engaging way to explore graph theory on Android devices.
